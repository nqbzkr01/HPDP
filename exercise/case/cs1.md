# Case Study 1: Frustration and anger as AZ slots are all snapped up

**Registration is a failure, say disappointed Malaysians who took to social media over the poor user interface**

PETALING JAYA: Malaysians were left frustrated over the poor user interface for the AstraZeneca opt-in vaccine registration, which opened for the second time today for Malaysians aged below 60.

Despite the many problems, the million available slots were snapped up in less than an hour.

Stay up-to-date by following FMT's Telegram channel
According to the Covid-19 vaccine supply access guarantee special committee (JKJAV) website, registrations have now closed after being open at 12.15 pm.

However, the second round of registrations left many Malaysians frustrated, angry and confused over what has been described as ‚Äúincompetent‚Äù programming.

Many have taken to Twitter to complain about several website glitches, such as being unable to view the vaccine distribution centres despite refreshing the website multiple times.

Netizens also complained of being forced to enter and re-enter details for over an hour only to be blocked from submitting their applications.

Some also noted the RM70 million budget announced to run the website.

One user Anusha Rym tweeted: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me to bersabar (be patient) if you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have multiple family members depending on you to register for the vaccine because they are illiterate. This is ******* stressful and Malaysians deserve better @JKJAVMY @Khairykj.‚Äù

Anusha told FMT she was attempting to register a total of five family members, who were all in their 50s.

She said her two uncles work in the construction sector, and another was a handyman. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that they get vaccinated,‚Äù she said.

Another user who was trying to register for his mother said: ‚ÄúI had my developer tool open to see what‚Äôs going on. The way they built it is not worth RM70 million. Many basic mistakes I wouldn‚Äôt make.‚Äù

User Jeff Sandhu also tweeted on the various system failures, saying it was being run on free cloud apps.

‚ÄúThe codes are such a mess. Please @JKJAVMY @Khairykj , don‚Äôt do this to us. Give it to someone with a great record of building these platforms. RM70 million is a joke, a bad one. #AstraZenaca #CucukMYAZ.‚Äù

Vaccine registrations for the AstraZeneca opt-in programme opened on May 23 for Malaysians above 60 in Johor, Selangor, Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak.

Vaccine minister Khairy Jamaluddin said 228,000 senior citizens had signed up for the prioritised vaccine slots.

Over a million doses of the vaccine were procured for this round of the opt-in programme.

Meanwhile, MUDA secretary-general Amir Abd Hadi urged Khairy to clarify who was awarded the contract to develop the registration site.

He pointed out that many people were questioning why the site was facing issues, despite costing around RM70 million to develop.

‚ÄúAfter several times, the website has failed to meet the standards and make it easier for people to register for the vaccine,‚Äù he said, adding that the public had also discovered that the site was run using a free version of Cloudflare.
